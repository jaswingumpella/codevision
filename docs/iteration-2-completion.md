# Iteration 2 Completion Summary

## Scope
- Extend the ingestion slice so that each analysis captures build metadata, Java class topology, and OpenAPI snippets for a Maven repository (single or multi-module).
- Persist a structured snapshot (`ParsedDataResponse`) plus per-class records, and expose them through a dedicated overview endpoint and UI panel.
- Ensure the system gracefully handles cyclic relationships while scanning the codebase.

## Backend Deliverables
- **Source scanning**
  - `JavaSourceScanner` walks `src/main/java` and `src/test/java` for every Maven module discovered via the root POM (or nested POMs when the root is purely an aggregator).
  - Each discovered type is parsed with JavaParser and translated into a `ClassMetadataRecord`, capturing FQN, package, inferred stereotype, source set (MAIN/TEST), annotations, implemented interfaces, and a `userCode` flag.
  - Cycle safety: graph traversals rely on adjacency lookups and `visited` tracking to avoid infinite recursion.
- **Build metadata extraction**
  - `BuildMetadataExtractor` reads the root `pom.xml` (or scans nested POMs if the repository is a module-only structure) to collect `groupId`, `artifactId`, `version`, Java release/target, and module directories.
- **YAML/OpenAPI scan**
  - `YamlScanner` aggregates OpenAPI YAML assets into a `MetadataDump`.
- **Persistence**
  - New `class_metadata` table stores all parsed classes for later enrichment.
  - `project_snapshot` rows now include derived build info, project naming, repo URL, and serialized `ParsedDataResponse`.
- **Services & APIs**
  - `AnalysisService` orchestrates cloning, scanning, metadata persistence, and snapshot creation.
  - `ProjectSnapshotService` now hydrates snapshot reads by merging persisted JSON with `class_metadata` rows when the stored snapshot is sparse.
  - New `GET /project/{id}/overview` endpoint returns `ParsedDataResponse` for UI consumption while `POST /analyze` continues to respond with `{"projectId": ..., "status": "ANALYZED_METADATA"}`.

## Frontend Deliverables
- React UI enhanced with an overview panel that, after a successful analysis, fetches `/project/{id}/overview` and displays:
  - Build information (group/artifact/version/Java).
  - Class coverage totals (total/main/test counts).
  - OpenAPI spec inventory.
- Vite dev server now proxies both `/analyze` and `/project/**` calls to the Spring backend.

## Configuration Notes
- Existing configuration keys remain (`git.auth.*`, `security.apiKey`). Leaving `security.apiKey` blank disables API key enforcement for local development.
- H2 files continue to live under `backend/data/`; tables now include `project`, `project_snapshot`, and `class_metadata`.

## Verification
- Automated: `mvn test` inside `backend/` and `npm test` (optional) inside `frontend/`.
- Manual workflow:
  1. Start backend: `mvn spring-boot:run`.
  2. Start frontend: `npm run dev` and browse to `http://localhost:5173`.
  3. Submit a Maven repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic`).
  4. Confirm the success banner shows the project ID and the overview card displays build data, class counts, and OpenAPI insights.
  5. Reload `/project/{id}/overview` directly (with curl or browser) to verify the JSON snapshot.

## Known Constraints
- The `userCode` heuristic currently treats packages under `com.barclays` and `com.codeviz2` as first-party; all other packages are scanned and stored but flagged as external.
- WSDL/XSD assets are captured in the metadata dump but are not yet rendered in the UI; the dedicated SOAP viewer is scheduled for Iteration 3.
- Static media assets (images, diagrams checked into the repo) are not yet inventoried. Iteration 3 adds the first image-scanning pass.
- Gradle builds remain out of scope until a later iteration.
- The current UI only exposes OpenAPI YAML content; SOAP WSDL/XSD artifacts are captured but will surface in the dedicated viewer planned for Iteration 3.

## Next Iteration Preview
- Iteration 3 will build on this metadata foundation to add API inventory, DAO analysis, and richer YAML/WSDL processing per the iteration plan.
