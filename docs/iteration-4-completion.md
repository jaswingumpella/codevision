# Iteration 4 Completion Summary

## Scope
- Expand the analysis pipeline to understand database usage (entities, repositories/DAOs, CRUD intent).
- Persist database metadata so it appears alongside existing build, class, and API insights.
- Surface the new information through both API contracts and the React dashboard.

## Backend Deliverables
- **Entity discovery:** `JpaEntityScanner` parses JPA annotations to capture entity names, table bindings, primary keys, fields/columns, and relationship hints. Results are persisted in the new `db_entity` table and folded into `ParsedDataResponse.dbAnalysis.entities`.
- **Repository/DAO classification:** `DaoAnalysisServiceImpl` inspects Spring Data interfaces, infers CRUD intent (including inline `@Query` annotations), and writes results to `dao_operation`. The JSON snapshot now exposes `classesByEntity` and `operationsByClass`.
- **Snapshot upgrade:** `ParsedDataResponse` and `ProjectSnapshotService` hydrate/dehydrate the new `dbAnalysis` section, enabling older snapshots to benefit from persisted metadata.
- **API surface:** Added `GET /project/{id}/db-analysis` to the OpenAPI spec and generated models, plus controller wiring that maps snapshot data to the new response type.
- **Regression safety:** Added focused unit tests for the entity scanner, DAO analyzer, updated controller/service tests, and adjusted existing fixtures to include the new snapshot field.

## Frontend Deliverables
- **Database tab:** The React app now fetches `/db-analysis` and renders two tables—entity ↔ repository mapping and DAO operations (method, CRUD intent, target, query snippet)—with loading and empty states that mirror the rest of the dashboard.

## Documentation
- README, iteration plan, and JSON schema docs now reflect the database analysis feature set, new REST endpoint, and storage tables.

## Verification
- Automated: `mvn -pl api test` (includes new scanner unit tests).
- Manual: `npm run build` to ensure the updated UI compiles.
- Sanity: Exercised the analyzer against sample repositories to confirm the new tab populates and API responses serialize correctly.

## Known Constraints & Follow-Ups
- DAO analysis currently focuses on Spring Data interfaces; classic hand-written DAOs beyond the interface pattern will be covered in a later iteration.
- Extremely large repositories may benefit from pagination/filtering in the Database tab—left for iteration 6+ alongside diagram generation.
