# Iteration 1 Completion Summary

## Scope
- Deliver a vertical slice that clones a repository, persists project metadata, and exposes the `/analyze` API secured with an optional API key.
- Provide a lightweight React UI so a user can trigger analysis and view the resulting project identifier.

## Backend Deliverables
- Spring Boot application configured with Java 21 and Lombok for concise data classes.
- `GitCloneService` clones public repositories by default and applies credentials only when `git.auth` values are supplied.
- `ProjectService` performs overwrite semantics on the `project` table using the repository URL as the unique key and stamps the latest analysis time.
- `/analyze` endpoint accepts `{"repoUrl": "..."}` and returns `{"projectId": ..., "status": "ANALYZED_BASE"}` after cloning and persisting.
- `ApiKeyFilter` guards non-GET requests when `security.apiKey` is populated.
- H2 database persists project records at `backend/data/codevision`.

## Frontend Deliverables
- Vite + React single-page form with fields for repository URL and optional API key.
- Frontend derives the project name client-side for immediate feedback and displays the project identifier returned by the backend.
- Requests proxy through Vite to the Spring Boot backend during local development.

## Configuration Notes
- Set `git.auth.username` and `git.auth.token` in `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml` when cloning private repositories; leave blank for public access.
- Update `security.apiKey` in the same file to require clients to supply `X-API-KEY`.
- Frontend expects the backend to run on `http://localhost:8080`; adjust `frontend/vite.config.js` if the target changes.

## Verification
- Automated: `mvn -q test` in `backend/`.
- Manual smoke test:
  1. `mvn spring-boot:run` inside `backend/`.
  2. `npm install` (first run) then `npm run dev` inside `frontend/`.
  3. Submit a repository URL (and API key if configured) via the UI and confirm the success banner shows the project ID.
  4. Re-submit the same URL to confirm overwrite behavior without errors.

## Known Constraints
- Analysis stops after recording the project metadata; deeper source scanning and diagram generation arrive in later iterations.
- Temporary clone directories are cleaned on failure but not yet persisted for downstream processing.

## Next Iteration Preview
- Begin source discovery and metadata scanning as outlined in Iteration 2 of `iterationPlan.md`.
- _(This work has now been delivered; see [`docs/iteration-2-completion.md`](iteration-2-completion.md).)_
