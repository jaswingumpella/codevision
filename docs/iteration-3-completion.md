# Iteration 3 Completion Summary

## Scope
- Catalog every externally facing API surface (REST, SOAP, servlet, JAX-RS) discovered during repository analysis and persist it for later consumption.
- Surface API specifications (OpenAPI / WSDL / XSD) alongside a media-asset inventory that downstream documentation can reference.
- Extend the React dashboard with a dedicated “API Specs” experience, including pagination for large catalogs and in-place spec viewers.

## Backend Deliverables
- **Comprehensive API scanning**
  - `ApiScanner` now walks every module’s `src/main/java`, normalizing Spring annotations case-insensitively and resolving inherited mappings through interfaces.
  - REST coverage: mapping annotations (`@GetMapping`, `@RequestMapping`, etc.) are collected even when the concrete method lacks attributes, and OpenAPI `operationId`s are matched back to implementation methods when available.
  - SOAP coverage: Spring-WS `@Endpoint`, JAX-WS `@WebService`, and servlet-based SOAP handlers are detected; WSDL parsing (via `WsdlInspector`) enriches responses with service/port/operation summaries.
  - Legacy coverage: classic servlets (mapping derived from `web.xml`) and JAX-RS resources are cataloged.
- **Specification + asset capture**
  - `YamlScanner` now aggregates OpenAPI specs, WSDLs, XSDs, and synthesizes SOAP service summaries.
  - `AssetScanner` inventories repository images (PNG/JPEG/GIF/SVG) with relative paths, byte size, and SHA-256 hashes.
- **Persistence & response model**
  - New JPA entities/repositories: `ApiEndpoint`, `AssetImage`.
  - `AnalysisService` wipes and repopulates `api_endpoint` / `asset_image`, assembles spec artifacts, and persists them inside `ParsedDataResponse` snapshots.
  - Build metadata falls back to the first discovered module when the root `pom.xml` is absent, ensuring group/artifact/version are still populated for aggregator-only repos.
- **API surface**
  - `/project/{id}/api-endpoints` (API-key protected) exposes the full catalog.
  - `ParsedDataResponse` now includes `apiEndpoints` and `assets`, while `MetadataDump` carries OpenAPI, WSDL, XSD, and SOAP service summaries.

## Frontend Deliverables
- **API Specs tab**
  - Tabbed panel beside the Overview card with grouped tables for REST, SOAP, and Legacy endpoints (each paginated in slices of 10 entries).
  - Spec viewers render OpenAPI YAML, WSDL, and XSD content inside collapsible code blocks; SOAP service summaries list service → port → operations.
- **Media assets**
  - “Media Assets” section enumerates image artifacts with file name, relative path, and size for quick download references.
- Pagination state resets between analyses so navigating multiple repositories remains intuitive.

## Configuration & Data Store
- H2 now contains `api_endpoint` and `asset_image` in addition to prior tables.
- No configuration changes are required; existing `application.yml` keys continue to work. Leaving `security.apiKey` blank still disables the API key filter for local development.

## Verification
- Automated: `mvn -pl api test` (includes a new unit test covering JAX-WS detection of SOAP methods).
- Manual regression flow:
  1. `mvn -f backend/pom.xml spring-boot:run`
  2. `npm run dev` inside `frontend/`
  3. Analyze representative repositories:
     - REST-heavy (e.g., `spring-projects/spring-petclinic`)
     - SOAP-focused (`zjcz/sample-soap-service`, `Evolveum/midpoint-custom-soap-service`)
     - Multi-module without root POM (`avraampiperidis/maven_multi_module_project_example`)
  4. Confirm endpoint tables populate, spec viewers render WSDL/XSD/YAML, and image assets list when present.
  5. Hit `/project/{id}/api-endpoints` with the stored project ID to validate the REST response matches the UI.

## Known Constraints & Follow-Ups
- Download links for spec artifacts and image assets are enumerated but still rely on repository-relative paths; exporting binaries remains on the backlog.
- UI pagination currently provides fixed-size pages (10 rows). Client-side filtering/sorting will be considered in a later iteration.
- No diagram generation yet—the outputs from API metadata feed into Iteration 6’s PlantUML/Mermaid step.
- The Confluence export and JSON snapshot now have richer payloads; downstream consumers should expect the new fields.

Iteration 4 (Database analysis) builds on these foundations, leveraging endpoint metadata and assets for compliance-driven views of persistence and DAO activity.
