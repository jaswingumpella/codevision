Confluence-Style Documentation Structure

When CodeDocGen exports the Confluence-ready HTML document, it organizes the content into clear sections with headings, roughly as follows (each numbered section corresponds to a major heading or topic in the document):

1. Overview: A brief introduction including the project name, repository URL, and summary of the project. This section also lists basic info such as the Maven coordinates (Group:Artifact:Version) and Java version. It may include a bullet list of key metrics (e.g., “Number of classes: X, Controllers: Y, Entities: Z, etc.”) to give a one-glance summary.

2. API Endpoints: This section contains tables enumerating all discovered API endpoints. It is often divided into subsections for different API categories:

REST Endpoints: A table with columns: HTTP Method, Path, Controller Class, Method. Each row is one REST API operation.

SOAP Endpoints: A table of SOAP web service operations (if any), with columns like Operation (or SOAP Action), Endpoint Class, Method. Possibly also Service/Port if multiple services.

Legacy Endpoints: If applicable, a table for servlets or JAX-RS resources, showing their URL patterns and handling classes.

If OpenAPI or WSDL definitions were found, the section also notes them. For example, it might say “OpenAPI specification found: openapi.yaml (attached below)” or embed a snippet. But the full content of specs is usually placed in the Metadata section (to avoid overwhelming the main narrative).

3. Diagrams: A series of subsections each providing a different diagram that documents the architecture:

Class Diagram: An overview of classes and their relationships. Instead of an image, the PlantUML source code of the diagram is embedded here inside a <pre><code> block. (Likewise for Mermaid source if preferred, but typically one format is included to avoid duplication – PlantUML is used since Confluence can render it with a plugin.)

Component Diagram: (Likewise, PlantUML text of the component diagram.)

Use Case Diagram: (PlantUML text showing actors and use cases.)

ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram): (PlantUML text showing the database schema design.)

Sequence Diagram(s): For key call flows, the PlantUML for sequence diagrams is included. There might be one main sequence (e.g., the primary use case of the system) or multiple sequences for different endpoints. Each sequence diagram text is labeled or captioned accordingly.

Each of these diagram subsections is clearly labeled, and the text is in a code block so that if this HTML is pasted into Confluence with the PlantUML plugin, the diagrams will render automatically, or at least the text can be easily copied to an external renderer. (No SVG or image files are directly embedded in the HTML export to keep it self-contained and text-based.)

4. Database Analysis: This section details how the code interacts with the database.

Entities and Interacting Classes: A table or list that for each Entity (table) lists the classes (DAOs/repositories) that use it. For example: “OrderEntity – used by OrderRepository, LegacyOrderDao”.

DAO/Repository Operations: A table listing each data-access method. Columns might be: Class & Method, Operation Type, Entity/Table, Notes. Example row: “OrderRepository.save() – INSERT – OrderEntity – (uses Spring Data save)”.

Optionally, if the ERD diagram is not too large, it might be included again or referenced (but since the ERD PlantUML was given above, we might not duplicate it here).

5. Logger Insights Summary: A summary of findings from the logging analysis. This might include:

A count of total log statements found, and how many were flagged with PII or PCI risks.

Perhaps a small table of the top 5 most sensitive log messages. For example, list a few log statements that were flagged (class, level, message snippet).

Or just a narrative like “No high-risk data found in logs” or “Some log statements include potential credit card data (see Logger Insights section of the tool for details).”

Since the full list can be long, the HTML might not list every log line, but it could. However, given large projects, summarizing is safer to keep the document concise.

6. PCI/PII Scan Summary: Similar to above, a brief overview of the sensitive data scan results:

e.g. “X potential PII/PCI exposures were found in the codebase.” Then perhaps categorize: e.g. “– 2 HIGH severity (hard-coded credentials), 5 MEDIUM, 3 LOW. – All instances of credit card patterns were in test data files.”

If the list is short, they could be listed. If long, we may just direct the reader to the CSV/PDF or the tool.

The idea is to communicate if the codebase seems clean or has areas of concern.

7. Gherkin Features: A list of the BDD feature files (if any). For each feature, list its title and perhaps scenario names. This shows what behaviors are specified by tests. It might look like:

“Feature: Order Processing – Scenarios: Place order successfully, Payment fails displays error”

“Feature: Customer Login – Scenarios: Successful login, Wrong password lockout”.
This gives auditors insight into what’s tested/covered.

8. Build & Dependency Info: This section reiterates the technical stack info:

Maven group/artifact/version, Java version.

Perhaps the list of major frameworks detected (e.g. “Uses Spring Boot 2.5, Hibernate, Log4j 2…” – this could be gleaned from dependencies or classpath scanning).

If not automatically, at least mention that it’s a Maven project with certain packaging.

Could also list the modules if multi-module (“Modules: common-lib, order-service, payment-service” etc.).

9. Footer: A small footer noting the generation details:

“Document generated by CodeDocGen on 2025-10-27 for repository https://github.com/org/my-java-service.”

This provides traceability (knowing when the analysis was done and for which source).

Each section in the HTML export is clearly separated (e.g., with <h1>...</h1> or <h2> tags for the section titles, depending on how Confluence interprets them). The use of <pre><code> blocks for diagrams ensures no images are needed and that everything remains text (which is good for diffing and for Confluence wiki storage).

This structured document is meant to be a stand-alone technical overview of the project. A consultant or new developer could read it to quickly understand the system’s endpoints, architecture, data model, and any potential security concerns. The combination of tables, text, and diagram source (which can be rendered into actual diagrams via Confluence or external tools) achieves a comprehensive documentation output.

Sources: The revised PRD and iteration plan above incorporate content and requirements from the original PRD and subsequent iterations, ensuring support for multi-module Maven structures, all Java versions up to 21, SOAP/REST and legacy APIs, cyclic reference handling, and the newly added dependency parsing capability. Diagram generation outputs both PlantUML and Mermaid notations for each diagram type as specified. The JSON schema and Confluence export structure are designed per the PRD’s specification of a full snapshot for external tools and a documentation bundle for Confluence, respectively. All planned work is now detailed through Iteration 7, covering the remaining scope needed to deliver the complete CodeDocGen v1 functionality.
